-- Types are similar in Haskell and Java, but operators are different for some
-- For integer types, division and mod are represented by functions:
--  div and mod

--String cancatenation is ++

-- functions are prefix, can change using back tics (see below).

x :: Int
x = 10 `div`  5

-- operators are infix, can change using parenthese, see below

y = (+) x 3
